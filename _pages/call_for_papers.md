The First Workshop on the Foundations of Post-training (FoPt 2025) invites submissions of papers addressing theoretical and empirical challenges in post training in a single non-archival track. Submitted papers can be in short format (up to $4$ pages, excluding references), or long format ($12$ pages, excluding references). Accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop. Every paper will be peer reviewed by two to four reviewers and double blind. FoPt will award a best paper award as well as a best reviewer award.

The workshop solicits contributions addressing fundamental questions related to post-training in various levels of abstraction, including but not limited to the following topics of interest:


- **Statistical and computational foundations of alignment:** Eg. sample efficiency of fine-tuning methods
- **Optimization landscape of post-training:** Eg. stability and convergence guarantees
- **Statistical and computational limits of inference-time alignment**
- **Understanding models of supervision:** Eg. offline vs. online / rewards vs. comparison feedback
- **New formalizations of generalization:** Eg. In-context learning, length generalization
- **New learning paradigms:** Eg. weak-to-strong generalization, self-improvement
- **Other topics:** Abstract models of language generation and reasoning (Eg. chain-of-thought)


Paper submissions are due on **Friday, May 16th, 2025** and notifications will tentatively be sent out on the 30th of May.

### Important dates
(All dates are in 2025)

Submission deadline: Friday, May 16th, 5:00 PM EST
Author notification: Friday, May 30th
Workshop date: Monday, June 30th

### Dual submission policy

Since the workshop is non-archival, FoPt invites submissions that may be substantially similar to papers that have previously been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to a peer-reviewed conference or journal. However, in the interest of a fair review process, the paper review process will be double blind.

### Reviewing Philosophy
We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. We recommend the following video for a thoughtful discussion of such aims and related issues: [IACR Distinguished Lecture: Caught in Between Theory and Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPVWSG7-i_E).


## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and anonymization

Short format submissions are limited to 4 PMLR formatted pages, excluding references. Long format submissions are limited to 12 PMLR formatted pages, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Appendices must be uploaded as a separate file.

All details, proofs and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, or possibly in the appendices. However, submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), and so enough details, including proof details, must be provided in the main text to convince the reviewers of the submissions’ merits.

**Anonymization:** Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information. To the extent possible, authors should avoid including directly identifying information in the text. All relevant references, discussion, and scientific content must be included, even if this might provide significant hints as to the authors’ identity. Authors should generally refer to their own prior work in third person. Acknowledgments are not to be included in the submission.

Submissions are anonymized, and author names are withheld from reviewers.

**Style files:** Please use the following style files. The "[anon]" option in the LaTeX template should be used to suppress author names from appearing in the submission.
